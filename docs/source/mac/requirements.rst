Requirements
============

The new V7 software has the same basic hardware and operating system requirements as the previous clients. 
However, a few software specific requirements have changed to support newer features. Listed by slot type:

- CPU Slot Requirements OSX 10.7 or later

  - 64 bit CPU (core 2 duo or better)
  - Broadband internet connection or faster

- GPU Slot Requirements

  - GPU folding is not currently supported in OSX

Note: Under OSX, antivirus software can interfere with the Folding\@home client files and cause errors. 
We suggest configuring antivirus software to exclude the FAH client directory and especially the Work directory from the antivirus scanning list. 
This can be done by going into the exclusion list panel that every antivirus program has. 
The work subdirectory contains semi-random binary data and can confuse overly aggressive heuristic virus scanning.
